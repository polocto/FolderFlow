# FolderFlow

**Organize your media files by extension while preserving directory structure.**

FolderFlow is a command-line tool that helps you filter and move image and video files from a source directory to specified destination folders (e.g., `images/`, `videos/`), while keeping the original folder structure. It also supports creating a "regroup" folder with symlinks or hard links to all moved files for easy access.
