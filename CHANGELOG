### Removed

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- Initial project documentation:
    - This CHANGELOG file to track notable changes.
    - A README explaining the project goals and usage.
    - MIT license.

- Document classification using **dynamic, plugin-based filters and strategies**, allowing custom extensions.
    - Support for multiple source directories.

    - **Built-in filters**
        - Filter files by extension.
        - Filter files using regex patterns.

    - **Built-in classification strategies**
        - Classify files based on last modification date.
        - Classify files based on source directory hierarchy.

    - Optional parallel execution to improve performance.
    - Execution statistics for classification runs.

    - **File conflict handling strategies**
        - Skip existing files.
        - Overwrite existing files.
        - Rename files on conflict.
            - The default rename behavior checks whether the destination file is identical; if so, it is skipped.
            - When using overwrite mode, if multiple files resolve to the same destination path, only the last processed file is preserved.

    - **Dry-run mode**
        - Simulates the classification process without modifying the filesystem.
        - Displays expected execution statistics.
        - Does not resolve conflicts between files that would be moved.

    - **Regrouping file views**
        - Strategy-based regrouping.
        - Output modes:
            - Hardlink
            - Symlink
            - Copy
        - The output directory must not overlap with any source directory to prevent conflicts.
