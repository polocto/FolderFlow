# Developer Guide

Welcome to the **FolderFlow Developer Guide**.

This section is intended for developers who want to:
- Understand how FolderFlow works internally
- Contribute code or documentation
- Develop new filters or strategies
- Maintain or extend the core engine

If you are only interested in *using* FolderFlow, refer to the **User Guide** instead.

## What this guide covers

This guide explains:
- How the project is structured
- How data flows through the system
- How to set up a development environment
- How to test changes safely
- How to contribute in a consistent way

---

## What this guide does NOT cover

This guide intentionally does **not**:
- Re-explain the YAML configuration format
- Duplicate the Plugin API reference
- Teach Go fundamentals

Those topics are covered elsewhere.
