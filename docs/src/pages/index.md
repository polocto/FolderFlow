# 🌟 Welcome to FolderFlow

**FolderFlow** is an open-source tool for **automating file organization** using explicit, configuration-driven rules. It helps you keep directories structured and predictable over time — without manual sorting or ad-hoc scripts.

FolderFlow is built to be **transparent, safe, and scalable**, making it suitable for personal use as well as large file collections.

---

## 🎯 What FolderFlow Does

FolderFlow processes files in three clear steps:

1. **Scan** one or more source directories  
2. **Classify** files according to configurable rules  
3. **Organize** them into structured destinations  

Everything FolderFlow does is defined in a single configuration file, ensuring reproducible and understandable behavior.

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

FolderFlow is guided by a few core ideas:

- **Declarative over scripted** — you describe the result, not the procedure
- **Predictable over magical** — no hidden heuristics or guessing
- **Safe by default** — no silent overwrites or destructive behavior
- **Composable** — features work together without side effects
